### Introduction
**Git** is a fast distributed revision control system.

*This manual is designed to be readable by someone with basic UNIX command-line skills, but no previous knowledge of Git.*

Repositories and Branches and Exploring Git history explain how to fetch and study a project using git—​read these chapters to learn how to build and test a particular version of a software project, search for regressions, and so on.

People needing to do actual development will also want to read Developing with Git and Sharing development with others.

Further chapters cover more specialized topics.

Comprehensive reference documentation is available through the man pages, or git-help[1] command. For example, for the command git clone <repo>, you can either use:

***$ man git-clone***

or:

***$ git help clone***

With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see git-help[1] for more information.

See also Git Quick Reference for a brief overview of Git commands, without any explanation.

Finally, see Notes and todo list for this manual for ways that you can help make this manual more complete.
